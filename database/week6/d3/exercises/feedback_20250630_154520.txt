suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 1, point 4 and 5:  Consider adding constraints to the `new_film` table (e.g., unique name) and adding more robust checks to `customer_review` (e.g., data type validation, length restrictions on titles).
- Exercise 2, point 6:  The queries for finding the four movies could be more efficient. For example, instead of multiple separate queries, a single query combining conditions with appropriate JOINs could improve performance and readability.
- Add comments to explain complex queries or logic in Exercise 2, especially for the movie search in point 6.  Improve error handling.
- Standardize naming conventions (e.g., use underscores for multi-word column names consistently).
- Consider adding indexes to frequently queried columns for performance optimization.
