suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `__add__` method should return a new `Currency` object instead of just the sum of amounts. This is more consistent with object-oriented principles and avoids potential side effects.
- Exercise 1's output for `print(c1 + c3)` should explicitly raise a TypeError, it currently only prints a message, and should explicitly raise the TypeError exception.
- In Exercise 1,  add docstrings to all methods for better readability and understanding.
- Improve the formatting of the output in Exercise 7. Consider using a library like `tabulate` or `pprint` for better presentation of the list of dictionaries.
- In Exercise 7, the function `create_faker_users()` modifies a global variable (`data`). It's better to return the list of dictionaries from the function to avoid potential side effects and improve code clarity.
- Exercise 2 is missing. The instructions mention creating `func.py` and `exercise_one.py`, but no code for these files is provided.
