suggestions for improvement:
- The `Card` class should have `suit` and `value` attributes, not just a method that creates a deck.  The deck creation logic should reside within the `Deck` class.
- The `shuffle` method in the `Deck` class should use `random.shuffle` correctly (it currently returns `None`).
- The `deal` method could be improved by returning the dealt card instead of just printing it, allowing for more flexibility in how the dealt cards are used.
- Add error handling for the case where the user interrupts the program before it naturally terminates.
- Improve naming consistency (e.g., `sut` should be `suit`).
- The `__str__` method in the `Card` class is not used effectively and should be removed or modified to represent a single card, not the entire deck.
