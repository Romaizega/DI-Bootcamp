suggestions for improvement:
- The `users` array in `auth.js` should be replaced with a persistent database solution (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) as suggested in the exercises.  Storing user data in memory makes the application vulnerable and not suitable for production.
- Add error handling for database operations (if a database were used).
- Improve the password strength validation regex. The current one is basic.
- Implement email confirmation as outlined in the exercises to enhance security.
- Add rate limiting to `/login` and `/refresh` endpoints as suggested in the exercises to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- The `authMiddleware` attempts token refresh but isn't entirely robust.  Consider a dedicated refresh endpoint (as implemented in the `auth.js`) and handle cases where both access and refresh tokens are invalid.
- Add more robust input validation to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- Consider using a more secure method for handling cookies, such as the `Secure` flag (when using HTTPS).
