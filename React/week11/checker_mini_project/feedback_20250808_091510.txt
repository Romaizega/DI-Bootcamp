suggestions for improvement:
- **Improve Error Handling:** The error handling is generally good, but it could be more specific.  Instead of generic 'Server error' messages, provide more context-specific error messages to aid debugging and user experience. For example, if a database query fails, indicate the type of query and the potential cause.  Consider using a dedicated error handling library for more robust and centralized error management.
- **Input Validation:** While input validation is present for registration, consider expanding it to other endpoints.  Always validate user inputs on the server-side to prevent vulnerabilities, even if you've already validated on the client-side.
- **Database Connection Pooling:** The database connection isn't explicitly using connection pooling. Implementing a connection pool can significantly improve performance, especially under load, and reduces resource consumption by reusing existing connections.
- **Authentication improvements:**  The `refreshAccessToken` endpoint is missing some robust error handling.  Always explicitly validate the existence and format of the `refreshToken` before attempting any JWT verification to prevent potential vulnerabilities. 
- **Authorization Middleware Consistency:**  The `authorizeStoryAuthor` and `authorizeStoryAccess` middleware functions have slightly different naming and handling. The code uses slightly different ways to get `storyId` from request, and is inconsistent. Aim for a consistent naming convention and function signature for enhanced maintainability.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Ensure consistent use of `async/await` in all database interaction code. This improves readability and error handling, preventing unexpected behavior from promise chains.
- **Environment Variables:**  While .env files are used, consider explicitly mentioning the need to set JWT_SECRET and REFRESH_SECRET to values (strong random values) in the instructions for developers deploying the application.  Additionally ensure you are not accidentally committing these secrets to the repository.
- **Frontend Redux Optimization**: Consider using selectors to reduce the amount of re-renders by extracting the relevant data for the components reducing unnecessary computations.
