suggestions for improvement:
- The `vote` function could be optimized for performance with a more efficient search algorithm if the array of languages were significantly larger.  Consider using a different data structure or a more optimized search method if performance becomes a concern.
- Add error handling for unexpected input to the `vote` function. While unlikely in this simple example, it's good practice. 
- Consider using a more descriptive name for the `updadLang` variable (e.g., `updatedLanguages`).
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA attributes to the button elements.
