suggestions for improvement:
- Add error handling for the case where the server is unreachable or returns a non-2xx status code.
- Consider using a more descriptive state variable name than `serverResponse`.
- Improve security by validating user inputs on the server-side to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS attacks.
- For better readability, separate the React component and the Express server code into separate files (App.js and server.js).
- Enhance performance by optimizing the fetching process. For example, you can add a timeout to the fetch request to avoid indefinite waiting if the server is unavailable.
