suggestions for improvement:
- Use `react-router-dom` instead of `react-router`. The instructions specified `react-router-dom`.
- In `App.js`, the `path` `/home` is redundant as you already have a route for `/` that renders the `Home` component. Remove the `/home` route.
- Consider adding loading states and error handling to your JSON fetching components (`PostList`, `Example1`, `Example2`, `Example3`) to improve user experience.
- Improve the styling of your components for better visual presentation. The current styling is minimal.
- Add more robust error handling within the `ErrorBoundary` component. Consider capturing more specific error information and providing more meaningful feedback to the user.
- The `Shop` component immediately throws an error; this might not be the desired behavior for an error boundary demonstration.  Consider a more gradual error introduction.
