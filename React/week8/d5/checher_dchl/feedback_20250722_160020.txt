suggestions for improvement:
- The spelling of 'Complited' should be corrected to 'Completed' in the button text.
- Consider adding error handling for unexpected actions in the reducer.
- For better readability, you could extract the filtering logic into a separate function.
- The use of `useRef` is good, but the implementation might be enhanced.  Currently, `inputRef` is not directly used for focusing on the input field when editing.  Adding `inputRef.current.focus()` inside `handleEditTask` would enhance user experience.
