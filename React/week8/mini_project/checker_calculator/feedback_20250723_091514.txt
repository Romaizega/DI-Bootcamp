suggestions for improvement:
- Improve error handling for non-numeric input.  Currently, it will likely result in NaN, which is not user-friendly.
- Add input validation to prevent unexpected behavior (e.g., division by zero). While the code handles this specifically for division, it could benefit from a more robust approach.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `num1` instead of `number_1`).
- The spelling of 'muliply' should be corrected to 'multiply'.
