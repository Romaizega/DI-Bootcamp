suggestions for improvement:
- The code doesn't prevent displaying the same quote twice consecutively.  Implement a mechanism to ensure uniqueness.
- Add error handling.  What happens if `quotes` or `colors` is empty? Consider a fallback message or loading indicator.
- Improve styling.  The current styling is minimal. Consider adding more robust styling for better presentation.
- The variable names `getRandomeQuote` and `getRandomeColor` have a typo ('Randome').
- Consider using a more descriptive name for the component than 'Quotes'.
