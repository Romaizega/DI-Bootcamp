suggestions for improvement:
- Add error handling for image loading failures.  If an image URL is invalid or unavailable, the carousel should gracefully handle the situation, perhaps displaying a placeholder image or message.
- Consider using more descriptive class names (e.g., `carousel-image`, `carousel-caption`) for better maintainability and readability.
- The image URLs are hardcoded. For better maintainability, consider storing them in an array or fetching them from an external data source.
- Add styling to improve the visual presentation.  The default styling might not perfectly align with design preferences.
