suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only renders a `Users` component.  It lacks the Redux store setup, Redux Thunk middleware, Redux slices for user data, Thunk action creators, and the implementation of `useSelector` and `useDispatch` as detailed in the chapter instructions.  The code does not fetch or display user data from an API.
- Add the necessary Redux setup (store, thunk middleware, slice, etc.) as outlined in steps 1-5 of Exercise 1.
- Implement a Thunk action creator to fetch user data from an API.
- Create a UserData component that uses `useSelector` to access and display the fetched data and `useDispatch` to dispatch the Thunk action.
- Include error handling to manage potential API request failures.
