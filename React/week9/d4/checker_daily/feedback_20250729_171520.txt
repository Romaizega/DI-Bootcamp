suggestions for improvement:
- The `TaskList` component renders a select element for category selection, duplicating functionality with `CategorySelector`.
- Error in the reducer `editCategory` in `categorySlice`. The `find` method returns an object which needs to be addressed and the name assigned to the object directly.
- Improve performance by memoizing selectors further, especially `selectTasksByCategory`, which is recalculated on every render.
- Add input validation to prevent adding tasks with empty titles or invalid category IDs.
- Add more comprehensive error handling in reducers and actions, for instance logging unexpected scenarios.
- Consider using a more robust and secure way of generating unique IDs for tasks rather than `uuidv4()`.
