suggestions for improvement:
- Improve error handling for cases where a day key is missing from `tododays` in `SelectDay`.  Currently, it might cause an error.
- Add a date picker component instead of a simple select to allow for better user experience.
- In `TodoList`, add visual cues to the user when an edit is in progress (e.g., highlight the edited task).
- Implement input validation in `TodoList` to prevent adding tasks with empty titles or descriptions.
- Consider using a more robust state management solution for larger applications (e.g., Zustand or Jotai) as Redux can become overly complex for simpler applications
- Add loading states and error handling to enhance UX in case of API calls or other asynchronous actions (though not explicitly in scope of provided instructions).
