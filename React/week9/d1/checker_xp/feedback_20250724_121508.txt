suggestions for improvement:
- Use a more descriptive name for `ACTION_ADD_TASKS`, `ACTION_REMOVE_TASKS`, and `ACTION_MARK_TASKS` (e.g., `ADD_TODO`, `REMOVE_TODO`, `TOGGLE_TODO_COMPLETION`).
- Consider using `immer` to simplify reducer logic and enhance readability. Immer allows direct mutation of the state within the reducer, making it easier to update complex objects.
- Add error handling in case of unexpected actions or data.
- Improve the UI with CSS styling for a better user experience.
- The initial state contains a hardcoded todo.  Consider starting with an empty todo list in the initial state.
