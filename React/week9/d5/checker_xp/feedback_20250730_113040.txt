suggestions for improvement:
- In `UserCard`, consider using a more descriptive name than `UsercardProps` for the type.  Perhaps `UserCardProps`.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each component and its logic.
- For better error handling in `UserList`, consider a more user-friendly error message instead of just displaying the raw error message. 
- In `App.tsx`, add a title to improve the overall structure and make it clearer what each component is displaying.
