suggestions for improvement:
- The `List` component's `key` prop in the `map` function should ideally use a unique identifier from the item data (e.g., `book.id`) instead of the index.  Using the index is generally discouraged for better React performance and predictability, especially if items are added or removed frequently.
- Minor typo: `setbook` should likely be `setBook` for better naming conventions.
- Add error handling for empty title or author inputs in `addNewBook` function to enhance user experience.
- Consider adding input validation to prevent the addition of duplicate books or books with invalid titles/authors.
