suggestions for improvement:
- The `TaskInput` component's naming could be improved to `TaskInput` for consistency.  A minor typo.
- Add input validation to `TaskInput` to prevent adding tasks with empty names.
- Consider adding error handling for edge cases (e.g., unexpected data types) in the reducers.
- The UI could benefit from visual cues for completed tasks (e.g., checkboxes, strikethrough text).  This is already partially implemented but could be improved.
- Separate the task list display from the task addition and removal logic. The `TodoList` component is currently doing too much.
- Use more descriptive variable names (e.g., `addTask` instead of `addTasks`).
