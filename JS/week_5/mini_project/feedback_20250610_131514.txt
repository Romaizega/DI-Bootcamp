suggestions for improvement:
- Improve error handling by providing more specific error messages to the user, indicating the type of error encountered (e.g., network error, API error).
- Add loading indicator specifically to the button during API calls to prevent multiple clicks.
- Enhance styling to better match the provided example image (colors, fonts, layout).
- Consider adding input validation to prevent unexpected behavior if the API returns unexpected data.
- The comment  `//4. Make sure you display the "Home World" of each Star Wars Character (use console.log() to help you get the data)` in the instructions is unnecessary as the code already correctly handles this.
