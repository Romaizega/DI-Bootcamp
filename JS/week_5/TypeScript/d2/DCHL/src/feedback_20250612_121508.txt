suggestions for improvement:
- The `Library` constructor should ideally handle the case where the initial `books` array is not provided or is null or undefined.
- Add input validation to prevent adding books with duplicate ISBNs to avoid data inconsistencies.
- Consider adding error handling to `getBookDetails` to manage cases where no book matches the provided ISBN, rather than just returning `undefined`.
- The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of various methods and the overall design choices. Adding comments will greatly improve readability.
