suggestions for improvement:
- The function could include error handling for cases where the input array contains elements that are not of type `User`, `Product`, or `Order`.  A more robust solution might check the type of `arr` before accessing its properties.
- Using a `switch` statement instead of multiple `if` statements could improve readability and potentially performance for a larger number of types.
- Consider adding a default case in a `switch` statement to handle unexpected data types, providing a clear error message instead of silently ignoring them.
