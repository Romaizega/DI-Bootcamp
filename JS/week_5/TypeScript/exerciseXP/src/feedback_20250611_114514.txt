suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, use a more descriptive variable name like `helloWorld` instead of `hello`.
- In Exercise 7,  add an HTML element with the id "input" to the HTML file to make the code executable.  The current code will throw an error if run directly because `document.getElementById("input")` will return null.  Consider adding error handling for cases where the element isn't found.
- In Exercise 9, the function overloading isn't explicitly demonstrated.  Consider creating separate function signatures for different parameter types or use optional parameters more effectively to show clearer overloading.
- Improve code comments and use consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables).
