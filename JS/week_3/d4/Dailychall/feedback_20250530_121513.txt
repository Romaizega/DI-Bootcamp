suggestions for improvement:
- The function name `cloneGloceries` has a typo; it should be `cloneGroceries`.
- The `cloneGroceries` function doesn't demonstrate pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference as intended.  It modifies the original `groceries` object directly. A true demonstration would create a deep copy to show the difference.
- The `cloneGroceries` function should explicitly log the values of `user` and `shopping` before and after the modifications to clearly show the effects of pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.
- Add comments explaining the pass-by-value and pass-by-reference concepts demonstrated (or not demonstrated) in the code.
