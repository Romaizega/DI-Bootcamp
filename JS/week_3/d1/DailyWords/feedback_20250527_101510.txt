suggestions for improvement:
- The variable names could be slightly more descriptive. For example, `wordNot` could be `indexOfNot` and `wordBad` could be `indexOfBad`.
- Adding comments to explain the logic within the `if` condition would enhance readability.  Specifically, clarifying the checks for the existence of "not" and "bad" and the order of their appearance.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code should include error handling for cases where 'not' or 'bad' are not found in the sentence.  Currently, it will produce `undefined` which is not ideal.
- Improve variable names for better readability (e.g., `notIndex` instead of `wordNot`).
- Add comments to explain the logic, especially the conditional statement.
- The `defer` and `async` attributes on the script tag are redundant; `defer` is sufficient for this case.
