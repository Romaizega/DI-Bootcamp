suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 1, part I, point 5: The `slice` method needs parameters to specify the portion of the array to copy.  The current code doesn't remove 'Mary' or 'Yourname'.
- Exercise 1, part I, point 7: While the code correctly gets the last element, adding a comment explaining the logic would improve readability.
- Exercise 2: The bonus part could be made more efficient by using a single loop and a lookup array for suffixes.
- Exercise 3: The code handles non-numeric input and doesn't crash but could provide more user-friendly feedback if the input is not a number.
- Exercise 6: The code iterates through the object keys but doesn't construct the sentence as requested.  It prints key-value pairs instead of the intended phrase.
- Overall: Add comments to explain the logic of each step, especially in more complex parts of the code.

suggestions for improvement:
- Add comments to explain the logic of each part, especially in the loops and array manipulations.
- Use more descriptive variable names. For example, instead of `last`, use `lastPerson`.
- In Exercise 2, the bonus part can be improved by using a more efficient method to get the ordinal suffix instead of creating a separate array.
- In Exercise 7, the solution could be optimized for larger arrays by using a more efficient sorting algorithm.
- Handle potential errors, such as the user entering non-numeric input in Exercise 3.
