suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, the ternary operator can be simplified with a lookup array or a function for ordinal suffix generation. This improves readability and maintainability.
- Exercise 4's bonus part could use more descriptive variable names for better understanding.  For example, instead of `onlyRole` and `listLastName`, consider names like `fullStackResidents` and `fullStackResidentLastNames`.
- Add comments to explain the logic in more complex parts of the code (e.g., the ternary operator in Exercise 2).
