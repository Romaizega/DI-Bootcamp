suggestions for improvement:
- The code only creates a form; it doesn't handle the submission or JSON output as required.
- The form uses GET which is not ideal for submitting data.  It should use POST.
- The 'outputdisplay.html' file is referenced but not provided.  The actual JSON output to the DOM isn't implemented.
- Add JavaScript to handle form submission, data retrieval, JSON creation, and DOM manipulation.
- Improve the placeholder text for better user experience.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code doesn't create a form; it only displays data presumably passed through URL parameters.
- The code lacks a form with 'name' and 'lastname' fields and a submit button as specified in the instructions.
- It doesn't dynamically append JSON to the DOM after a form submission.
- The code reads data from URL parameters instead of a form, deviating completely from the chapter's requirement of creating a form and handling its submission.
