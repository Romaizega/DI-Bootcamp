suggestions for improvement:
- Improve styling to match the example image more closely.  The example shows a specific font and layout.
- Add error handling for empty inputs.  Currently, submitting with empty fields will just output an empty JSON object. A user-friendly message could improve the user experience.
- Consider using `textContent` instead of `innerText` for better performance and cross-browser compatibility, especially with complex content.
