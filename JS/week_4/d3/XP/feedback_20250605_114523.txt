suggestions for improvement:
- The code could include a more descriptive variable name than `jsonMarioGame` (e.g., `marioGameJson`).
- While the code correctly pretty-prints the JSON using `JSON.stringify(marioGame, null, 2)`, adding a comment explaining the purpose of `null` and `2` would enhance readability.
