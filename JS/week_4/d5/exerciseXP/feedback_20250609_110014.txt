suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1 and 2, consider adding a more user-friendly error message to the `catch` block instead of just logging the error.  For example, display an alert or a more descriptive message on the webpage.
- In Exercise 1 and 2,  the API key is hardcoded.  For better security and maintainability, consider storing the API key in environment variables or a configuration file, rather than directly in the code.
- Improve code comments in Exercise 1 and 2 to clarify the purpose of each function and the meaning of variables.
- In Exercise 3, the function name `getStarShip` could be more descriptive; something like `fetchAndLogStarshipData` would improve readability.
